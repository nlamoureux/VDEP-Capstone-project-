# VDEP-Capstone-project-
The VDEP (Vehicle Diagnostic for Engine Problems) is a program used to assist individuals in daignosing issues
with a vehicle. This program utilizes a query system, which takes advantage of a person's senses to do this. The user then
may store the issue to a list, and repeat the process or view/delete the list. The list is sorted by date/time the issue was added.
